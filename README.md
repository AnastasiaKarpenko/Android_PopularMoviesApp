# Android_PopularMoviesApp
A project for Udacity Associate Android Developer Fast Track program.

A movie app that shows popular movies from The Movie DB. 
The app allows to:
- browse top rated movies,
- browse the most popular movies of all times,
- shows the overview of each movie,
- shows the list of trailers (watching opportunities in Youtube app), 
- shows reviews (from The Movie DB website using WebView),
- mark a movie as favourite (in progress)
- browse the list of favourite movies (in progress)

The app supports both portrait and landscape modes.  

Android concepts that I learnt during working on this project:
- Activities and Fragments lifecycle, 
- Master pane layout,
- Networking with Retrofit,
- Data serialization with GSON,
- UI elements like ViewPagers, WebViews, RecyclerView,
- Data persistence (SharedPreferences, SQLite database, Content Provider)
